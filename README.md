# Tic-tac-toe

# Description 

Nowadays, this game is known all over the world. Each country may have its own version of the name, sometimes the rules are different, but the meaning of the game remains the same. Below are the main rules that may be familiar to you since childhood.

Tic-tac-toe is a game played by two players on a 3x3 field where the duel takes place. One of the players plays as 'X', and the other player is 'O'. 'X' plays first, then the 'O' side plays, and so on.

The first player that writes 3 'X' or 3 'O' in a straight line (including diagonals) wins.

However, our game should show the field in an "intermediate" states too. Let's try to visualize different combinations that the user will determine from the input. It is also important to think about the interface and set boundaries for our field.

In addition to analyzing the field, it is equally important to add the ability to select a cell for your move. Now you need to implement human moves. Let's divide the field into cells.

The program should ask to enter the coordinates where the user wants to make a move.

Note that in this stage user moves as X, not O. Keep in mind that the first coordinate goes from left to right and the second coordinate goes from bottom to top. Also, notice that coordinates start with 1 and can be 1, 2 or 3.

But what if the user enters incorrect coordinates? The user could enter symbols instead of numbers or enter coordinates representing occupied cells. You need to prevent all of that by checking a user's input and catching possible exceptions.
